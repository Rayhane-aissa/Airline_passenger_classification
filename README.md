# ðŸ›« Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

## 1. Problem Statement

Customer satisfaction is a critical factor for the airline industry, playing a major role in service quality improvement and business retention. To meet evolving customer expectations, airlines must build efficient systems for evaluating and predicting passenger satisfaction.

This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and predict airline passenger satisfaction using real-world data obtained from Kaggle.

## 2. Project Overview

This is a **supervised classification machine learning project** focused on predicting whether an airline passenger is satisfied with their experience based on flight and service-related features.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyze passenger satisfaction patterns
- Apply classification algorithms to predict satisfaction
- Evaluate and compare model performance

---

## 3. Workflow & Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzed distributions and relationships in passenger data
- Identified key factors influencing satisfaction
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical features

### Models Used:
Implemented and compared various classification models including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision tree
- Random Forest

### Model Evaluation:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score


### Model Optimization:
- Conducted **hyperparameter tuning** (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)
- Selected the best-performing model
